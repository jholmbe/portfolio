# context & summary 
projectDescription: | 
    The classic Snake game, built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript, with a fully custom, responsive UI designed from
    scratch in Figma.
    I created this project independently, inspired by a 
    <a href="https://github.com/practical-tutorials/project-based-learning?tab=readme-ov-file" target="_blank">project-based learning repository</a> 
    that I found. My main objective was to learn javascript fundamentals and produce something tangible. The initial version of the game was rather rudimentary,
    so I thought—why not give it personality?

        <h1>UI DESIGN</h1>
        <p>
            I leaned into a nostalgic and retro vibe—using a 2000s-era TV model. The colors are from a mix of 
            vintage photos. The logo mimics the metallic, embossed brand tags commonly found on those models. 
            The interactive keys, quicker snake, and pause function were added for more feedback and to match
            our ever decreasing attention spans. The snake and apple pixel art was inspired by other sprite media.

        <h1>THE CODE</h1>
        <p>
            Prior to starting this project, I worked through the MDN Web Docs on core HTML/CSS and JS modules (minus the React section). 
            I'm more comfortable in Python so programming logic isn't new to me, however, JavaScript syntax definitely still is. I do appreciate 
            clean, organized, and efficient code so I made an effort to group elements and be concise/descriptive with names.
            <br>
            <br>
            Furthermore, I kept a balanced approach when using AI tools. On one hand, I avoided them to practice my critical 
            thinking skills and maximize learning. On the other, AI was helpful for discovering JavaScript-specific concepts, coding conventions, 
            common practices, and for debugging my code.

        <p>
           I wasn't very comfortable using Git when I started this project, so I kept the documentation in a text file. 
           As I've contributed more to this website, I've become more confident with Git and wish I took full 
           advantage of the commit history.
