# context & summary 
projectDescription: | 
    <em>project: kilter</em> is a design project for UMD's INST451 class. The professor requested the class to design for a
    personal passion; my focus was weightlifting. Also, teaching staff provided mentorship during our five
    design sprints in the semester. The objective of the class was UI/UX and not the programming of the interfaces.
    <br>
    <br>
    Weightlifters with 2+ years experience lack tools truly optimized for their workflow. Spreadsheets and plain-text 
    methods are functional and customizable, but weren't designed with weightlifters in mind.
    <em>project: kilter</em> seeks to optimize current methods of tracking personal fitness by offering a user-friendly 
    interface, modular features, and leveraging the community through the plugins system.

        <h1>FINAL UI</h1>
        <p>
            This was an independent project. I developed a lightweight spreadsheet application with the guidance of real
            users. The product niche is the modularity of the plugins system, enabling lifters to choose their workflow.
            In combination, there is cross-platform compatibility (desktop & mobile), 3 included togglable plugins, and
            developer support. The minimalist design is inspired by my desire to declutter modern fitness interfaces, 
            and I like the color green.

        <h1>DESIGN PROCESS</h1>
        <p>
            This was an independent project. Design sprint 1 was for research while the rest was focused on increasing the 
            fidelity of the prototypes. My approach to design was very top-down—having decided on specific features and 
            figuring out how to add it. My specific process looked like analyzing competitors features or bits of software 
            that have served me in the past and creating my own variation of it. I used sites like Dribble and explored 
            many different products (not just fitness ones) to inspire my design.

        <h1>USER & MARKET RESEARCH</h1>
        <p>
            Throughout the project, I had reoccuring interviews with 5 intermediate-advanced weight lifters. In the initial 
            phase I had them all answer a google survey I put together. I made conclusions on primary motivations, important 
            values, and adding specific features, like an AI chatbot. The data from the discussions allowed me to create a 
            user persona, journey maps, compare competitors in the current market.
