# context & summary 
projectDescription: | 
    <em>project: kilter</em> is a 15-week solo design project for a UMD course, where I focused on my personal passion for weightlifting. 
    I designed a modular spreadsheet application to give seasoned lifters the streamlined control missing from traditional training tools. 
    The product centers on a plugin system and an intuitive interface that lets lifters customize their workflow to train more efficiently. 
    The scope was limited to interface design without coding requirements. Final deliverables included 12-14 polished Figma screens or a 
    project equal in effort.

        <h1>USER VALIDATION</h1>
        <p>
            Over the semester, I led recurring interviews with 5 seasoned weightlifters. Their feedback validated my 
            hypothesis to design simple and adaptable interfaces.

        <h1>MOBILE UI</h1>
        <p>
            Most interactions happen during workouts, making mobile the priority. As lifters progress, they require less structure and 
            more freedom, often favoring simple note-taking tools over rigid fitness apps. A <em>project: kilter</em> file starts as a
            single column with no grid lines. Users can add columns to define their own spreadsheet size.

        <h1>DESKTOP UI</h1>
        <p>
            Weightlifters often build routines while referencing multiple mediums. A desktop environment allows them to organize 
            information and structure programs more efficiently compared to mobile. Cross-platform syncing ensures a seamless workflow 
            between planning and execution.

        <h1>PLUGIN SYSTEM</h1>
        <p>
            Weightlifting goals are highly individual, much like programming or productivity. Accessed via a floating action button,
            plugins appear in a separate space. However, their functionality can be integrated into the spreadsheet itself â€” such as
            context-specific prompting or generating workouts.

        <p>
            If you're curious, you can explore the Figma file. This project taught me Figma, core UX practices, and the importance of keeping the
            scope narrow for efficient implementation. It ultimately evolved into a productivity tool that would be too challenging to build with 
            my current programming skills.
