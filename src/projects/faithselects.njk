# context & summary 
projectDescription: | 
    Solo freelance project improving a small Squarespace storefront. I streamlined the user flow, 
    preserved the brand identity, and improved content organization and clarity. FaithSelects is 
    run by two Christian mothers, Faith and Sue, who curate natural wellness remedies. Faith wanted 
    her existing storefront modernized while staying true to its roots.

{# DESIGN PROCESS #}

        <h1>PROCESS</h1>
        <p>
            Faith's main requirements were to work within Squarespace, keep the original media, 
            and create a modern feel. She also encouraged me to use AI, which I applied to refine 
            the written content. Working solely in Squarespace, I iterated on the site through 
            three rounds, explaining my decisions each time and incorporating feedback until all 
            requirements were met.

{# DESIGN DECISIONS #}

        <h1>DECISIONS</h1>
        <p>
            I structured the user flow around three priorities: present the brand, prioritize shopping, 
            then provide resources for deeper engagement. An interactive hero section leads the page, 
            followed by the best-selling products to encourage conversions. Site-wide content was 
            rewritten with AI assistance to make it concise, clear, and aligned with the original 
            meaning. Brand identity was maintained through earthy tones, re-used written material 
            and imagery, and the existing Squarespace template. The site layout uses clearly labeled 
            sections with color changes and borders for easy scanning, while shop and blog pages were 
            reorganized into scannable grids. The mobile layout was fully reworked to accommodate these changes.
