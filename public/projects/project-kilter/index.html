          <div class="project-desc"><em>project: kilter</em> is a design project for UMD's INST451 class. The professor requested the class to design for a
personal passion; my focus was weightlifting. Also, teaching staff provided mentorship during our 5
design sprints in the semester (~12 weeks). The objective of the class was UI/UX and not the programming of the interfaces.
<br>
<br>
Weightlifters with 2+ years experience lack tools truly optimized for their workflow. Spreadsheets and plain-text 
methods are functional and customizable, but weren't designed with weightlifters in mind.
<em>project: kilter</em> seeks to optimize current methods of tracking personal fitness by offering a user-friendly 
interface, modular features, and leveraging the community through the plugins system.

        <h1>FINAL UI</h1>
        <p>
            This was an independent project. I developed a lightweight spreadsheet application with the guidance of real
            users. The product niche is the modularity of the plugins system, enabling lifters to choose their workflow.
            In combination, there is cross-platform compatibility (desktop & mobile), 3 included togglable plugins, and
            developer support. The minimalist design is inspired by my desire to declutter modern fitness interfaces, 
            and I like the color green.

        <h1>USERS, TRENDS, AND EXPLORATION</h1>
        <p>
            The first two sprints were exploratory. In Sprint 1, I focused on defining the scope: identifying a real problem,
            speaking directly with potential users, and conducting market research to understand both user pain points and 
            competitor trends. I synthesized this input into clear project goals and design principles. Sprint 2 was about 
            translating these insights into structure. I sketched early ideas, mapped out the user journey, and built the
            information architecture. This gave me a foundation to test assumptions early and establish a strong direction
            going into later iterations.

        <h1>ITERATIVE PRACTICE</h1>
        <p>
            With a clear direction, Sprints 3-5 were dedicated to testing, refining, and improving. Biweekly, I
            gathered feedback from users and mentors on usability and UI details. Every design decision was based
            on values from the users, such as simplicity, efficiency, and usability. I stuck to a defined feature
            list to stay user-centric. Throughout the process, I held my work to a high personal standard, 
            continually asking: <em>Does this design solve the problem in the most intuitive way possible?</em>

        <h1>REFLECTION</h1>
        <p>
            The project is public so feel free to take a look at my work. This was my first Figma project so
            I was learning the software itself alongside design practices. I'm incredibly happy with this project
            however if I had to do it again, I'd define a smaller scope instead of re-invent the wheel. This sort 
            of turned out as a productivity tool and might be hard to implement with my amatuer programming skills.
